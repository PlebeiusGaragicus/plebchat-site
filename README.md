## 🤖 Important information for agents:

1. Always read the docs/

1. We always ensure to both review documentation and keep it up-to-date with code changes.  Instead of adding new files, we keep updates terse and contained in the files that reference the features.  We don't include verbose changelogs or list of refactored code elements - we simply update the existing documentation to match.

1. The `reference/` directory in this repo contains **reference repositories** - our Svelte frontend/ directory contains our web app.

1. Project structure:

  - **`docs/`** - our MKDocs documentation hosted on Github Pages
  - **`frontend/`** - Svelte 5 web app
  - **`backend/`** - FastAPI backend for accepting payments - used by our LangGraph agents for payment validation and redemption
  - **`agent/`** - Self-hosted LangGraph agents

  - **`cyphertap`** is our fork of the repository since its `npm` library is out-of-date.  We build from and use our local submodule since it has new features not included in the origional repository. **Changes may be made to this submodule in order to further bugfix/develop its features!**

### Reference repositories

  - **`nutshell/`** a python library which handles self-custody ecash wallets - it is used in our FastAPI backend/ to store user's funds which were spent to pay for usage of our agents.

  - **`fullstack-chat-client`** is an example React frontend for demonstrating a chat UI between a user and LangGraph agent capable of tool calling.

  - **`chat-langchain`** contains a "production" example of a working reserach/reference agentic frontend using LangGraph Cloud
